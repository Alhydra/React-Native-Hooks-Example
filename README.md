My name is Youssef el habchi, from [React Native Master](https://reactnativemaster.com) I welcome each and everyone of you.



Hello everyone, welcome into this article where we are going make a React Native Hooks Example, with simple and good looking UI.  
By Building a mobile Url Shortener app.

React Hooks were introduced in React 16.8, and to put it simply, they let you turn stateless component into stateful.  
Meaning You can use functional component and still consume State and lifecycle method.

So we will try to build a url shortener app using hooks and exploring all logic behind it.


Feel free to read the whole article on my blog [React Native Modal Example](https://reactnativemaster.com/react-native-hooks-example/)
If you would like to try the app on Expo, I have prepared an expo project, check it from  [Expo.io](https://expo.io/@alhydra/react-native-hooks-example)
